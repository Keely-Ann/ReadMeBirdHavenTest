## üìñ How to run the Mobile Application
When you open the application, you will be greeted by a splash screen featuring the Bird Haven logo. From there, you'll be directed to the main page, where you have the option to either create a new account if you don't have one already or sign in with your existing account.

If you choose to create an account, you will be prompted to enter a username and password. Afterward, you can select the "Create Account" button, which will take you to the sign-in page for the Bird Haven mobile application. To return to the main page, simply select the "Back" button.

If you opt to sign in with your account, you'll need to enter your username and password. You can also choose to save your login information for easier future access by selecting the "Remember Me" checkbox. After entering your details, click the "Sign In" button to access the home page. To return to the main page, use the "Back" button.

On the home page, you'll find a horizontal scroll that enables you to explore a variety of bird images. Additionally, bird safety tips are displayed for your reading and awareness.

When you click on the "Bird Classifier" button, you'll be directed to the Bird Classifier page. Here, you can either capture or upload an image of a bird. If you upload an image that isn't a bird, a pop-up message will inform you that the image is invalid and prompt you to upload a valid bird image. If you've uploaded a bird image, click on the "here" text to be redirected to Google, where you can search for more information about the bird. To return to the home page, select the "Back" button.

Choosing the "Explore" icon in the bottom navigation bar will direct you to the Explore page. Here, you can view hotspots on a map or find the best route to a specific hotspot from your current location. To obtain directions to a particular hotspot, select the "Get Directions" button to receive directions and the best route to your selected hotspot.
Clicking the camera icon in the bottom navigation will lead you to the Sightings page. Here, you can create and save your bird observations. You can select an image or take a picture of the bird and provide details such as the current location, a description of the observation, and the observation date. Click the "Add Observation" button to save the observation, and a pop-up toast message will confirm the successful addition.

If you select the "Observation" icon in the bottom navigation, you'll be directed to the Observations page, where you can view all your bird observations. To edit an observation, choose the "Edit" button, which will bring up an edit form where you can modify the title, description, and date. You can close the pop-up by selecting the "Cancel" button or save your changes by clicking "Save." If you wish to delete an observation, a confirmation pop-up message will appear, asking if you are sure you want to delete it. Selecting the "Delete" button will permanently remove the observation.

By clicking the "Settings" icon in the bottom navigation bar, you'll be directed to the Settings page. Here, you can edit your profile, choose a measurement system (imperial or metric), and set your preferred maximum distance (from 10 to 100 units). The default settings are the metric system (miles) with a preferred maximum distance of 10 units. If you want to edit your profile and change your password, a pop-up will allow you to do so. Once you've made changes, select "Edit" to save them. The system settings allow you to choose your preferred measurement system and distance.
